# Introduction

RbxSync syncs Roblox Studio with your filesystem—bidirectionally, automatically, and with full property preservation. Use git for version control and let AI agents help build your game.

## Why RbxSync?

- **No More "Which Version?"**: Everyone syncs from git. One source of truth for your whole team
- **All Properties, Not Just Scripts**: Extracts Parts, GUIs, Animations, Sounds—everything—using Roblox API dump reflection
- **True Two-Way Sync**: Edit in Studio or VS Code. Changes flow both ways automatically
- **AI-Ready**: Built-in MCP server lets Claude and other AI tools extract, sync, test, and debug

1. **CLI** - Command-line tool for project management, building, and server operations
