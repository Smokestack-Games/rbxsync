--[[ This is a GUI that changes the "Color" value (in the Frame) to whatever color you click. Do what you'd like with this!
To make this a GUI, insert a ScreenGui to the "StarterGui" service. Then click and drag ColorFrame (this model) into it.
Please do NOT claim this as yours, this took a night and morning to complete, it was not easy! Thank you very much!
