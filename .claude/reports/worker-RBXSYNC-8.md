## Summary

Created comprehensive SEO strategy for rbxsync.dev with keyword research, page title recommendations, meta description templates, content opportunities, and technical SEO fixes.

## Changes Made

- `.claude/reports/seo-strategy.md`: Created full SEO strategy document

## Key Findings

1. **Current Gaps:**
   - Generic page titles missing keywords ("Introduction" vs "RbxSync: Two-Way Roblox Studio Sync")
   - Single global meta description for all pages
   - Homepage is a redirect (loses SEO value)
   - No sitemap.xml or robots.txt
   - No comparison/alternative content

2. **Target Keywords:**
   - Primary: "roblox vscode sync", "rojo alternative", "roblox git version control"
   - AI-focused: "roblox mcp", "claude roblox", "roblox ai development"
   - Long-tail: "how to use vscode with roblox", "roblox studio external editor"

3. **Quick Wins:**
   - Update page titles with keywords
   - Add per-page meta descriptions via frontmatter
   - Create comparison page (Rojo vs Argon vs RbxSync)
   - Fix homepage to be landing page, not redirect
   - Add sitemap.xml and robots.txt

## PR

- No PR created (research task, no code changes)

## Issues Encountered

None - research completed successfully.

## Notes for Manager

- The SEO strategy complements the existing competitive-analysis.md report
- Competitor sites (Rojo, Argon) have weak SEO - opportunity to outrank them
- AI/MCP keywords are low competition and growing - should own this space
- Recommended 30-day action plan included in report
